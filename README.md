## DEV Prerequisites

- Nodejs 8.10+/npm, recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install nodejs/npm.
- A RingCentral developer account: you need [sign up](https://developers.ringcentral.com/) and apply for the permission to create RingCentral add-in.
- Create an `Bot Add-in` app in RingCentral developer portal,
- Create a AWS account, we will use free AWS dynamodb, and put your aws credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`, check [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

## Quick start

Let's start it.

```bash

# install dependecies
npm i

# start proxy server, this will make your local bot server can be accessed by RingCentral service
npm run ngrok

# will show
Forwarding                    https://xxxx.ap.ngrok.io -> localhost:6066
# Remember the https://xxxx.ap.ngrok.io, we will use it later
```

then start the test server

```bash
# create env file
cp .env.sample .env
# then edit .env,
# set https://xxxx.ap.ngrok.io as RINGCENTRAL_APP_SERVER
# set glip webhook url copied as STATIC_WEBHOOK

# run local dynamo db, optional
npm run dynamo

# run local dev server
npm start

# run client
npm run c

```

Now login to [https://developers.ringcentral.com](https://developers.ringcentral.com), and create an `Bot add-in` type app with permissions: `ReadAccounts,Team Messaging,Webhoook Subscriptions`, and set `OAuth Redirect URI` to `https://xxxx.ap.ngrok.io/bot/oauth`， and goto Bot menu, add bot, then login to [https://app.devtest.ringcentral.com](https://app.devtest.ringcentral.com), and chat with `Lottery bot`.

Goto Glip app's App list, select your app, and choose a team, input some choices and submit, you will see the card in your select team, then team members can vote.

## Deploy to AWS Lambda
